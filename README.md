âš¡ Household Power Consumption Forecasting
A deep learning solution for predicting residential energy usage patterns

## ðŸ“Š Dataset Overview

2,075,259 measurements collected from a residence in Sceaux, France (near Paris)
47 months of continuous monitoring (December 2006 - November 2010)
Key metrics:
Global active power (kW)
Sub-metered energy (Wh) for specific circuits
Calculated "other appliances" consumption:
(global_active_power Ã— 1000/60) - sub_metering_1 - sub_metering_2 - sub_metering_3

## Data Quality Notes

1.25% missing values (preserved timestamps with empty measurements)
Gaps visible (e.g., April 28, 2007 shows consecutive semicolons)
Temporal resolution: Original minute-level data
## ðŸ§  Model Architecture

## Advanced Deep Learning Approach:

Built using TensorFlow optimizers for time-series forecasting
DateTime-indexed processing for temporal pattern recognition
Multi-resolution analysis:
Hourly resampling â†’ Captures daily usage patterns
Daily resampling â†’ Identifies long-term trends
Comparative analysis across time granularities
Technical Implementation:

Custom sequential neural networks
Adaptive learning rate scheduling
Memory-efficient batch processing
## ðŸ“ˆ Performance Evaluation

## Rigorous metrics for energy forecasting:

RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error): Measures average prediction error in original units
MSE (Mean Squared Error): Emphasizes larger errors
MAE (Mean Absolute Error): Robust to outliers
(Preliminary results show X% improvement over baseline methods)

## ðŸš€ Key Features

Multi-temporal analysis: Minute â†’ Hour â†’ Day transitions
Missing value resilience: Maintains temporal continuity
Energy decomposition: Isolates "miscellaneous" appliance usage
Production-ready pipeline: From raw data to predictions
